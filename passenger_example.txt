Deploying a Ruby on Rails application: an example

Suppose you have a Rails application in /somewhere. Add a virtual host to your
Apache configuration file and set its DocumentRoot to /somewhere/public:

<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName www.yourhost.com
# !!! Be sure to point DocumentRoot to 'public'!
DocumentRoot /somewhere/public    
<Directory /somewhere/public>
# This relaxes Apache security settings.
AllowOverride all
# MultiViews must be turned off.
Options -MultiViews
</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

And that's it! You may also want to check the Users Guide for security and
optimization tips, troubleshooting and other useful information:
